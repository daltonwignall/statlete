Write tests!!!
I couldn't get the date display for the scatter plot to work properly, so I just ended up using the game #, which is slightly less useful imo.
Validation capabablities on input component
absolute paths within .scss files
Local storage for basic application state
The twitter feed is just for the NBA's right now, I would like to make it per player. Unfortunately I have to pull their twitter username based on full name to do that. I have to route this through node, which I don't have time for right now :(
Better mobile responsiveness
Better graph responsiveness
Make search trigger on enter keypress also
Return more than one match if an NBA player has the same name, then let the user decide which ones they want to add
Integrate login system for user specific configuration and storing data permanently
Disable stat arrows when the first/last item is showing for the left and right arrows respectively
It would be nice to get this deployed somewhere
