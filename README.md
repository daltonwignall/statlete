# Statlete

Sports statistics platform for finding instant stats on your favorite athletes!

## Summary
This platform was created as a way to aggregate information about athletes. With a focus on stats. This is a micro proof of concept of a moonshot idea. The intention is to make it easy to learn more information about your favorite athletes within seconds!

**Note:** The player stats only pull for nba players who were active within the 2018-2019 season. This was an intentional decision to keep the scope possible. Filtering for other seasons/years could definitely be added in the future though!

## Setup
```bash
cd statlete
```
^^^ The client statlete folder within the root statlete folder.. so `statlete/statlete`

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

From here this should launch a browser on `localhost:3000` and you should see the interface!
